# EcoHub

## 💫🔎Inspiration 

Inspired by Hack Club, we created a prize-incentive-based web app that motivates people to engage in eco-friendly activities through challenges and competition. Combining our passion for environmental incentives, we aim to make sustainability fun and rewarding. We first designed the website using Figma to plan the pages and visualize them. In the meantime, we worked out the foundations for the back-end and front-end of the website using the React and Express framework.

## 🥊Challenges we ran into

We dealt with a new framework and troubleshot issues using Stack Overflow. There were also errors with the website's functionality as we developed it, requiring some clever engineering to bypass them. Additionally, we managed the integration of the front end and back end, as well as the implementation of complex graphics.

## ✌️👌Accomplishments that we're proud of

Ensuring we got enough sleep was crucial for maintaining high quality of thought and innovation throughout the project. Adequate rest allowed us to approach challenges with fresh perspectives and creativity, which was essential for problem-solving and developing innovative solutions. This focus on well-being not only improved our individual performance but also fostered a collaborative and dynamic environment where new ideas could thrive.

## 👓🤓What we learned

Throughout the project, we learned about the critical importance of effective communication and how it underpins successful teamwork. Clear, consistent communication ensured that everyone was on the same page, reducing misunderstandings and streamlining our workflow. Additionally, we became proficient in using Git Bash and explored the extensive features that GitHub provides. These tools were invaluable for version control, enabling us to track changes, collaborate seamlessly, and manage our codebase efficiently. GitHub's features, such as pull requests, issue tracking, and project boards, facilitated smooth collaboration and helped us maintain a high standard of code quality.

## 🎓What's next for EcoHub

Moving forward, we plan to add more detailed graphics to enhance the visual appeal and user experience of our platform. Extending our reach to the worldwide market is also a key objective, allowing us to tap into a broader audience and cater to diverse user needs. Additionally, we aim to introduce an "Insight" feature, which will analyze the dedication of each user over time. This feature will provide valuable metrics and feedback, helping users track their progress and engagement while allowing us to understand user behavior better and tailor our services accordingly.
